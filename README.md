# yiimp
Install script for yiimp on Debian 9

While I did add some server security to the script, it is every server owners responsibility to fully secure their own servers. After the installation you will still need to customize your serverconfig.php file to your liking, add your API keys, and build/add your coins to the control panel.

There will be several wallets already in yiimp. These have nothing to do with the installation script and are from the database import from the yiimp github.

If you need further assistance we have a small but growing discord channel at https://discord.gg/uQ5wdTC

*****Run the script as root*****

This script has an interactive beginning and will ask for the following information:

Your time zone
Server Name
Support Email Address
Server Admin Email Address
If you would like fail2ban installed
If you would like to have SSL (LetsEncrypt) installed - Your domain must be pointed to your
server prior to running the script or SSL will fail to install.
New custom location for yiimp admin login.

Once those questions are answered the script will then be fully automated for the rest of the
install.

This install script will get you 95% ready to go with yiimp.
There are a few things you need to do after the main install is finished.

You must update the following files:

1. /var/web/serverconfig.php - update this file to include your public ip to access the admin
   panel. update with public keys from exchanges. update with other information specific to your
   server.
2. /etc/yiimp/keys.php - update with secrect keys from the exchanges.

After you add the missing information to those files then run:
bash main.sh
bash loop2.sh
bash block.sh

To download and run

curl -Lo install.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crombiecrunch/yiimp_install_scrypt/master/install.sh
